## Project Approach and Technology
For the front end of the project, the team decided to use the React framework. This is because React is a framework that allows you to do many things and focus on the most important aspects of the project (implementing features) rather than coding everything from "scratch". Another reason for using React is because it is a framework that the members will most likely reuse in future projects. As for the project's backend, we will use the relational database management system MySQL and Python and SQL queries to interact with the database.

## Languages
- React.js
- Django
- SQLite3
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

## Technologies
- MySQL Workbench
- Visual Studio Code
- IntelliJ
- PyCharm
